# Some of My Projects

[Thrifting Alpha - Revitalizing Tired Alpha Factors Using Ensemble Learning](Thrifting_Alpha_Talk.slides.html)
Finding alpha is a constant search in algorithmic trading. New alpha factors are always exciting, but sometimes you can come up with new trading signals simply by applying novel aggregation techniques to familiar factors. In this talk we will discuss using ensemble learning methods to combine individual weak signals into stronger factors and assessing their predictive power for long-short equity strategies.

[Buying Happiness - Using LSTMs to Turn Feelings into Trades](Buying_Happiness_Talk.slides.html)
In this talk we discuss how to build a Twitter sentiment model in Python using Word2Vec and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), comparing and contrasting with more conventional statistical models. We cover basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, providing different ways to extract features from text data for use in modeling. We describe a potential use of this sentiment model in developing cross-sectional algorithmic trading signals for factor models, expanding upon previous work using Twitter data.
